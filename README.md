## What it is

Codetta is a small, fast desktop code editor that doesn't try to be VS Code. It ships in ~30 MB instead of 200+, has no telemetry, and treats AI as a first-class panel — *your* AI, with *your* keys.

**Highlights**

- **Best-in-class Claude Code integration** — uses your existing Claude Pro / Max subscription via the CLI. GUI permission cards (no more `--dangerously-skip-permissions`), session resume that hydrates the full prior transcript, branch from any past turn, MCP server browser, live spend tracking. See [What's new in v0.2.0](#whats-new-in-v020).
- **BYOK AI panel** — Claude Code, Anthropic API, OpenAI, and local Ollama all in one chat. Switch models mid-conversation.
- **Multi-workspace** — open several projects side by side; each has its own isolated, persistent state (open files, terminals, layout, AI chat history).
- **Multi-terminal with pop-out** — drop terminals into the bottom panel, or pop them out into their own OS window and re-dock when done. PTY survives the move.
- **Drag-and-drop tab splits** — drop any tab onto an edge to split a pane horizontally or vertically.
- **Integrated git** — branch picker, source-control panel, line-level gutter markers, diff viewer.
- **Monaco editor** under the hood — same engine as VS Code, with syntax highlighting, find/replace, formatting.
- **~30 MB native** — Tauri 2 + Rust backend, no Electron, no Node runtime required to run.
- **No telemetry** — zero phone-home. Your code, your keys, your machine.

## What's new in v0.2.0

The Claude Code integration overhaul. Full notes in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md):

- **GUI permission cards** replace `--dangerously-skip-permissions` — every Edit / Write / Bash / MultiEdit / NotebookEdit shows a real Allow / Allow always / Deny modal with tool-specific previews (literal command for Bash, unified diff for Edit, full content for Write). No more reaching for the unsafe bypass flag.
- **Session continuity** — multi-turn chats actually remember context. Codetta captures Claude Code's `session_id` and passes `--resume` on every follow-up turn, slashing per-turn cost and preserving the server-side prompt cache.
- **Session picker + transcript hydration** — browse past sessions for the workspace, click to restore the full conversation (not just an empty pane).
- **Branch from any past turn** into a new chat tab without disturbing the current one.
- **Timeline scrubber** — slider over past turns. The "no wrapper has this" feature.
- **Tool result rendering + inline diff card** — see what Claude actually read / ran, with `±` line stats and an expandable unified diff for every Edit.
- **TodoWrite checklist** sticky above the chat with live pulse on the in-progress item.
- **Spend dashboard** — per-chat cumulative cost + budget threshold + warning toast.
- **MCP server browser** — one-click installs for popular MCPs (filesystem, git, github, fetch, puppeteer, sqlite, postgres) per user or project scope.
- **Stream hardening** — fixes the documented [#1920 hang](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1920) and large-tool-result truncation.

## Install (end users)

### Windows

Download the installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/getcodetta/codetta/releases/latest):

| File | Use this if… |
|---|---|
| `Codetta_<version>_x64-setup.exe` | **Recommended** — NSIS installer, adds Start Menu entry + uninstaller |
| `Codetta_<version>_x64_en-US.msi` | You're deploying via SCCM / Intune / GPO |
| `codetta.exe` | Portable — run without installing (single executable) |

After install, launch **Codetta** from the Start Menu. The first run prompts you to open a folder.

**Locations on disk**

| Item | Path |
|---|---|
| Binary (per-user install) | `%LocalAppData%\Codetta\` |
| Binary (system install) | `C:\Program Files\Codetta\` |
| Workspace state | `%AppData%\codetta\` |
| Uninstall | Settings → Apps → Codetta |

### macOS

Download `Codetta_<version>_universal.dmg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/getcodetta/codetta/releases/latest) — universal binary covers both Apple Silicon and Intel.

> First-launch only — Gatekeeper will warn because the binary isn't notarized yet (notarization is on the roadmap). Either right-click the app → Open → Open to bypass once, or run `xattr -cr /Applications/Codetta.app` after first install.

### Linux

| File | Use this if… |
|---|---|
| `codetta_<version>_amd64.AppImage` | **Recommended** — portable, runs on most distros. `chmod +x` then double-click. |
| `codetta_<version>_amd64.deb` | Debian / Ubuntu. `sudo apt install ./codetta_<version>_amd64.deb` |

## Setting up AI (one-time, per provider)

Open **Settings → AI Providers** and add a key for whichever provider(s) you want.

| Provider | What you need | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code CLI** ⭐ | Install [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) and `claude login` | **Uses your existing Claude.ai Pro / Max subscription — no extra billing.** Or pay-per-token if you log in with an API key. |
| **Anthropic Claude (API)** | API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) | Pay-per-token |
| **OpenAI** | API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) | Pay-per-token |
| **Ollama** (local) | [Install Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) and `ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b` (or any model) | Free, local |

> 💡 **Already pay for Claude Pro or Max?** Use the **Claude Code CLI** option instead of the API. After `claude login`, Codetta talks to Claude through the CLI, which runs against your subscription (5-hour usage caps per your plan tier) rather than the metered API. For most coding work this is significantly cheaper than per-token API billing.

You can mix providers freely — switch models from the chat panel's model picker mid-conversation.

## Develop / build from source

### Prerequisites

| | Version | Install |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js** | 18+ | https://nodejs.org |
| **Rust toolchain** | 1.77+ stable | https://rustup.rs |
| **Tauri prerequisites** | per-OS | https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/ |
| **(Windows) WebView2** | Auto-installed by Edge / Tauri bootstrapper | usually already present |

After installing Rust, make sure `cargo` is on your `PATH`. On Windows:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $env:PATH + ";$env:USERPROFILE\.cargo\bin", "User")
```

Then close and reopen your terminal.

### Clone and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getcodetta/codetta.git
cd codetta
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

The first run pulls Rust crates and builds the Tauri shell — expect 3–10 minutes. Subsequent runs are seconds (incremental).

### Build a release installer

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

Outputs land in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`:

- `nsis/Codetta_<version>_x64-setup.exe` — recommended Windows installer
- `msi/Codetta_<version>_x64_en-US.msi` — enterprise MSI
- `src-tauri/target/release/codetta.exe` — portable executable

### Useful scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server only (no Tauri shell) |
| `npm run build` | Type-check + build the frontend (no Tauri) |
| `npm run tauri dev` | Full app with Rust backend + hot reload |
| `npm run tauri build` | Production installers |

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome at [github.com/getcodetta/codetta](https://github.com/getcodetta/codetta).

Please follow [DCO sign-off](https://developercertificate.org/) on commits (`git commit -s`) — no CLA required.

**Scope statement** — to keep Codetta lightweight and finishable, we deliberately do **not** plan to add: a full extension/plugin system, language-server protocol support, integrated debugger, telemetry, or built-in cloud sync. The goal is a fast, focused editor that does its job well.
