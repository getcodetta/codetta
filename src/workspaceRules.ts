// Workspace AI rules loader — reads optional persistent instructions
// from the workspace and prepends them to the system prompt for ALL
// providers, not just Claude Code.
//
// Why this exists: Claude Code already auto-loads CLAUDE.md natively.
// Anthropic API / OpenAI / Ollama users had no equivalent — opening a
// chat in a Django project gave the model no idea about Django
// conventions, project-specific patterns, or "always do X here"
// preferences. This module closes that gap so the same rules apply
// regardless of which provider the user picks.
//
// File search order (first hit wins):
//   1. .codetta/rules.md   — explicitly Codetta's, takes precedence so
//                            users can override CLAUDE.md per-editor
//   2. CLAUDE.md           — shared with the Claude Code CLI; common
//                            case for users who already authored it
//   3. .cursorrules        — Cursor-style; lets users migrating from
//                            Cursor reuse what they had
//   4. .cursor/rules.md    — newer Cursor convention (multi-file rules
//                            collapse to the first one found)
//
// Truncated to MAX_RULES_BYTES so a runaway rules file can't blow up
// the system prompt and burn unexpected tokens.
