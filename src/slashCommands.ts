// Slash-command catalog for the AI chat input. The chat panel reads
// this list when the user types `/` to render an autocomplete menu and

// Pure data — no React, no closures over chat state. The chat panel
// supplies the runtime behaviour (rewriting input vs. firing an
// in-app action) by inspecting `prompt` / `action` on the entry it
// matched. Extracted from AIChatPanel so adding or tweaking the
// catalog doesn't require touching the giant file.
